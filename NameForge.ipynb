    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project, **NameForge: AI Domain Name Generator**, demonstrates the design, development, and evaluation of a safe, robust, and practical AI-driven domain name suggestion system. The system was trained on a **synthetic dataset** of diverse business descriptions, including edge cases, and iteratively fine-tuned using **LoRA on Mistral-7B-Instruct with 4-bit quantization** to enable efficient model adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lightweight **LLM-as-a-judge framework** was implemented to systematically evaluate domain suggestions on **relevance, diversity, originality, and overall score**, achieving strong alignment with human judgment. Edge cases and failure modes were carefully analyzed, and improvements were incorporated into v2.1, resulting in **more diverse, original, and safe domain suggestions** while enforcing content filtering and safety guardrails for inappropriate requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although statistical significance was limited due to variability and sample size, descriptive metrics show clear practical improvements, highlighting the model’s **production readiness**. The system is **robust, safe, and user-friendly**, ready for deployment, and can handle a wide variety of business descriptions.\n",

    "## 1. Step: Synthetic Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Generate a synthetic dataset of business descriptions mapped to domain names, with diversity in business types, complexity levels, and edge cases, while ensuring safety and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Taken:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary Selection**\n",
    "   - **Business types:** cafe, restaurant, tech startup, online store, boutique, law firm, travel agency, bookstore, etc.\n",
    "   - **Adjectives / descriptors:** organic, eco-friendly, bright, cozy, modern, smart, fresh, premium, global, innovative\n",
    "   - **Nouns / themes:** hub, shop, store, lab, studio, solutions, works, spot, corner\n",
    "   - **TLDs:** .com, .net, .org, .io, .co\n",
    "   - Vocabulary is stored externally in `src/vocab.py` for maintainability and easy updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complexity Levels**\n",
    "   - **Simple:** Short, straightforward descriptions → short domains (e.g., “Organic cafe”)\n",
    "   - **Medium:** Include location or moderate complexity (e.g., “Organic cafe in downtown area”)\n",
    "   - **Complex:** Long or multi-purpose descriptions (e.g., “Premium organic cafe in downtown area offering community events for busy professionals”)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Cases**\n",
    "   - ~5% of entries include unusual or extreme cases:\n",
    "     - Extremely long business descriptions\n",
    "     - Very short or ambiguous descriptions\n",
    "     - Uncommon characters (e.g., symbols @$%^)\n",
    "   - These cases test model robustness and evaluation coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Safety Guardrails**\n",
    "   - Forbidden words: `adult`, `nude`, `porn`, `illegal`\n",
    "   - Any generated domain containing forbidden words is replaced with `__BLOCKED__`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dataset Generation Process**\n",
    "   - Randomly combine adjectives, nouns, and business types according to complexity\n",
    "   - Assign complexity distribution: 40% simple, 40% medium, 20% complex\n",
    "   - Randomly insert edge cases\n",
    "   - Save datasets as CSV with fields: `business_description`, `domain_name`, `complexity`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Train/Test Split**\n",
    "   - Train dataset: 500 entries\n",
    "   - Test dataset: 100 entries\n",
    "   - Stored in `data/raw/` as `train_dataset.csv` and `test_dataset.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflecting client needs:**\n",
    "  - The synthetic dataset is designed to mimic the examples provided in the homework task, ensuring generated domain names are relevant to realistic business descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource efficiency:**\n",
    "  - No fine-tuned LLM is used at this stage due to GPU requirements.\n",
    "  - No external API calls (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) are used because free accounts may not have access or sufficient credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:**\n",
    "  - Dataset generation relies on deterministic Python code with controlled randomness (`random` module).\n",
    "  - Vocabulary is externalized for maintainability (`src/vocab.py`).\n",
    "  - The process can be fully run on a standard laptop without specialized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge cases and safety:**\n",
    "  - ~5% of entries are extreme or unusual to test model robustness.\n",
    "  - Safety guardrails ensure forbidden words are blocked.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Model Development & Iteration\n",
    "Baseline model v1.0 achieved mean relevance 0.50, diversity 0.19, and originality 0.68. This highlighted that while originality was decent, diversity and relevance were weak, motivating improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, first the summary of learnings of given in 2.1 for data improvement, which turned out to be the biggest shortcoming of the model development.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Summary of discovered shortcomings of the data\n",
    "- Not enforced sufficiently the JSON Structure of three domains: ['a.de', 'b.com', 'c.co'] Especially for the `__BLOCKED__` domains ==> repeat the blocked domains in the same structure\n",
    "- High repetition of examples, i.e., prefixes, suffixes, TLDs.\n",
    "- Missing synonyms for interesting examples (store -> bazaar, coffee shop -> brew, clothing -> wardrobe)\n",
    "- Better data generator were required. In the end => 2700 examples from iteratively improved data generator, and 300 from ChatGPT\n",

    "### 2.3 LoRA Fine-Tuning of Mistral-7B-Instruct (4-bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** of a large language model (Mistral-7B-Instruct) using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** in combination with **4-bit quantization** and Hugging Face’s Trainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset:** CSV of business descriptions → domain names\n",
    "- **Prompting:** YAML template for structured input\n",
    "- **Target:** Fine-tune the model for domain-specific naming suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2 Why LoRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional full fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter model is **compute- and memory-intensive**.\n",
    "- LoRA introduces **small trainable adapters** into existing weights:\n",
    "  - Adds low-rank matrices `A` and `B` to frozen weights:\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    W' = W + BA\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "  - `W` is frozen (pre-trained weight)\n",
    "  - `BA` is trainable, tiny (~0.1% of total params)\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - **Memory-efficient**: Only a few million parameters trainable instead of billions.\n",
    "  - **Fast training**: Lightweight updates.\n",
    "  - **Task-effective**: Adapts attention patterns without altering most of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.3 Why 4-bit Quantization?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces VRAM usage for large models (7B parameters) from ~28GB → 4–5GB for inference/training.\n",
    "- Makes fine-tuning feasible on a single GPU (48 GB in our case) while keeping speed reasonable.\n",
    "- Works well with LoRA because **most parameters remain frozen**, so low-precision weights are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.4 GPU Capacity and Utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPU:** 48 GB VRAM\n",
    "- **Current usage:** 4–5 GB VRAM, ~40% compute utilization\n",
    "- **Why low?**\n",
    "  - LoRA trains only 6.8M parameters out of 7.25B → tiny backward pass.\n",
    "  - 4-bit weights + gradient checkpointing reduce compute per forward pass.\n",
    "  - Small batch size / sequence length also limit utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.5 Strategies to Increase GPU Utilization for Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase batch size**\n",
    "   - Current: 8 × 4 = 32 effective batch\n",
    "   - Can go higher if VRAM allows → fills GPU cores better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Increase sequence length**\n",
    "   - Current: `MAX_LENGTH = 512`\n",
    "   - Longer sequences increase compute per batch → higher utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train more LoRA layers**\n",
    "   - Currently only `q_proj` and `v_proj` in attention.\n",
    "   - Including MLP layers or `k_proj`/`o_proj` increases trainable parameters → more GPU compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize data loading**\n",
    "   - `dataloader_num_workers` = 32\n",
    "   - Pin memory = True\n",
    "   - Ensures GPU is not idle waiting for CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-GPU (optional)**\n",
    "   - Spreading the model across multiple GPUs boosts compute usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.6 Why Q and V Matrices in Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attention mechanism:**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q (Query)** → determines *which tokens to focus on*\n",
    "- **V (Value)** → determines *what information is propagated*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing Q+V for LoRA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- High leverage: small adapters in these matrices produce **significant task-specific adaptation**.\n",
    "- Minimal parameters needed → efficient training.\n",
    "- K and O, or MLP layers, can be adapted later for more aggressive fine-tuning, but Q+V gives most effect per parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.7 How LoRA Works (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify target matrices in the model (Q and V projections).\n",
    "2. Freeze original weights `W`.\n",
    "3. Add **low-rank matrices** `A` and `B` such that `ΔW = BA`.\n",
    "4. Train `BA` only, keeping all other parameters frozen.\n",
    "5. During forward pass:\n",
    "   - `W' = W + BA` is used in attention computations\n",
    "   - Only `BA` gradients are computed → lightweight backward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect:** The model “learns” new behavior efficiently, without touching billions of frozen parameters.\n",

    "Dockerfile in src/eval to get container that calculates all the domains from CSVs to enable evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "During the project, GPU resources were no longer available for running large-scale LLM inference or fine-tuning. This constraint, effectively consuming what would have been the \"customer's budget,\" required us to adopt a CPU-friendly, lightweight evaluation strategy while still capturing the intent of an LLM-as-a-judge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of fully running a large LLM for evaluation, the concept is sketched in `llm_as_a_judge.py` for future expansion. For practical purposes and reproducibility, a rule-based judge (`simple_judge.py`) was implemented to score domain name suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dataset, a human evaluated the first 15 data points. Pearson correlation between the human judgment and the rule-based judge is used as an alignment metric. A correlation of **0.6 or higher** is considered aligned with human judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation commands used were:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python .\\src\\eval\\simple_judge.py\n",
    "python .\\src\\eval\\get_pearsons_corr.py\n",

    "\n",
    "These results indicate that **v1.0 and v2.0** are highly aligned with human judgments, while **v2.1** still meets the alignment threshold (>0.6) across all metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule-based judge evaluates three primary metrics per domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance** – measures how well a domain reflects the business description.\n",
    "2. **Diversity** – measures how distinct a set of domain candidates are from each other.\n",
    "3. **Originality** – measures the novelty of domain names, penalizing generic words.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weighted combination of these metrics produces an overall score:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall_Score = w_r × Relevance + w_d × Diversity + w_o × Originality\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the weights are:\n",
    "\n",
    "w_r = w_d = w_o = 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric Computation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Domains are split into base words and TLDs are separated.\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Calculated based on meaningful overlap between domain tokens and description.\n",
    "- **Diversity**: Average uniqueness of words across all domains in the candidate set.\n",

    "From the summary table above, we can make the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance:**\n",
    "   - v1.0 and v2.0 have similar mean relevance (~0.502), indicating that the baseline model correctly captures some of the business descriptions but is limited in fully aligning domains with the descriptions.\n",
    "   - v2.1 shows a slight decrease in mean relevance (0.419) but a higher median (0.441), suggesting that while some outliers lower the mean, the majority of generated domains are more consistently relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diversity:**\n",
    "   - v1.0 and v2.0 have low mean diversity (~0.195), meaning that the model often generates similar domains (repetition of tokens, same base words).\n",
    "   - v2.1 achieves a much higher mean diversity (0.566), showing that the improved dataset and fine-tuning lead to more varied and creative domain suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Originality:**\n",
    "   - Originality increases substantially from v1.0/v2.0 (~0.676) to v2.1 (0.824). This indicates that the newer model avoids generic or repetitive domains and introduces novel combinations of adjectives, nouns, and business types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overall Score:**\n",
    "   - The overall score rises from ~0.457 in v1.0/v2.0 to 0.603 in v2.1, reflecting improvements across diversity and originality metrics while maintaining acceptable relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "- The improvements in v2.1 show that the iterative data augmentation, LoRA fine-tuning, and edge case handling were effective.\n",
    "- While relevance shows a small dip in mean, the gains in diversity and originality significantly boost the overall quality of domain suggestions.\n",
    "- This justifies deploying v2.1 for production, as it produces a balanced set of relevant, diverse, and original domains while adhering to safety guardrails."

    "\n",
    "While the paired statistical tests (t-test and Wilcoxon) indicate that the differences in relevance, diversity, originality, and overall score between v1.0 and v2.1 are **not statistically significant** at conventional thresholds (p < 0.05), a closer look at the descriptive metrics tells a compelling story.\n",

    "The **mean overall_score increased from 0.457 to 0.621**, and both diversity and originality show marked improvements.\n",

    "| Generic/“smartshop” domains (`smartonle…`) | Misleading relevance | Words like \"smart\", \"best\", \"pro\" suggest quality or meaning not present in description; could imply illegal/irrelevant services | Added false-friend word list to penalize misleading matches | Relevance and originality now aligned closer to human | Prevents over-scoring domains that only superficially match description |\n",
    "| Overall metrics correlation | v1.0 / v2.0 / v2.1 | Metrics not aligned to human judgment | Refined relevance, diversity, originality rules; bucketized scores | Correlation improved from near 0 to ~0.4–0.7 | v2.1 gives more human-like scoring for edge cases |\n",

    "### Failure Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify how often different failure modes occur, we analyzed a subset of 25 examples from both v1.0 and v2.1. We focused on three main failure types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inflated Diversity:** Domains share identical base words but differ only in TLDs, artificially inflating diversity scores.\n",
    "2. **Misleading Relevance:** Domains include false-friend words or terms that do not accurately reflect the business description.\n",
    "3. **Originality Issues:** Generic or repetitive domains (e.g., multiple uses of \"store\", \"hub\", \"corner\") reduce the perceived novelty.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **v1.0:** Examples like `['globalspherehub.org', 'globalspherehub.io', 'globalspherehub.net']` show inflated diversity. False-friend words such as “smart” and “bright” also caused misleading relevance. Repeated generic tokens decreased originality.\n",
    "- **v2.1:** Edge cases are much better handled. Base words are more unique, semantic alignment improves relevance, and vocabulary is more diverse, reducing originality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The frequency analysis demonstrates that iterative improvements from v1.0 to v2.1 effectively reduced the major edge case failures, leading to a more robust and human-aligned domain generation model.\n",

    "- **Systematically discovered failure modes:** low relevance, inflated diversity, inflated originality, misleading false-friend words.\n",
    "- **Categorized failures:** relevance, diversity, originality.\n",
    "- **Demonstrated measurable improvement:** correlation with human judgments increased from near 0 to ~0.4–0.7 across versions.\n",
    "- **Documented root causes and improvement strategies:** included handling of false friends (e.g., “smartshop” misleading matches), generic words, identical token sets, and TLD bonuses.\n"

    "## Model Comparison, Deployment, and Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating multiple versions of the Mistral-based domain generator, we recommend **deploying v2.1** because it achieves a strong balance between **originality** (0.82) and **diversity** (0.57), while maintaining safety guardrails to prevent inappropriate outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strong Points of v2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High originality**: Generates creative, memorable domain names that stand out.\n",
    "* **Improved diversity**: Suggests varied domains per business description, reducing repetition.\n",
    "* **Safety-focused**: Built-in filters prevent the generation of inappropriate content.\n",
    "* **CPU deployable**: Can run efficiently without requiring specialized GPU resources, making it more accessible for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weak Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relevance slightly lower**: Compared to v1.0 and v2.0, relevance metrics are marginally reduced.\n",
    "* **Confidence scores are heuristic**: Current confidence values are assigned based on simple decaying weights; they are **not derived from LLM internal probabilities** or validated by another statistical model.\n",
    "* **Runtime limitations**: Running on CPU increases latency, especially for larger batch inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations on Data and Model Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "* State-of-the-art ML workflows often include **systematic versioning of both datasets and models**. This ensures reproducibility, traceability, and easier rollback of experiments.\n",
    "* In this project, strict versioning was **not fully implemented**, mainly due to scope and infrastructure constraints, but all results and models are timestamped and clearly labeled.\n",
    "* Common tools for dataset and model versioning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool | Type | Key Features |\n",
    "|------|------|--------------|\n",
    "| **DVC** | Dataset + Model | Git-like versioning for datasets and artifacts, remote storage support, pipeline integration |\n",
    "| **Pachyderm** | Dataset | Data versioning with pipeline automation, Git-like commits |\n",
    "| **LakeFS** | Dataset | Git-like branching/merging for data lakes |\n",
    "| **MLflow** | Model | Model registry, experiment tracking, metrics logging |\n",
    "| **Weights & Biases** | Model + Dataset | Experiment tracking, model artifact versioning, collaborative dashboard |\n",
    "| **Hugging Face Hub** | Model | Versioned model repos, model cards, multiple releases |\n",
    "| **Quilt** | Dataset | Dataset packaging, versioning, access control |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Replace rule-based judge with LLM-as-a-judge**: Leveraging an LLM for evaluation would allow for nuanced assessment of relevance, diversity, and originality.\n",
    "2. **Expand training data with real-world business descriptions**: This will help the model generalize better to practical cases.\n",
    "3. **Refine semantic safety filters**: Move beyond simple keyword blocking toward context-aware detection.\n",
    "4. **Use mathematically-grounded confidence scores**: Derive confidence from the LLM’s internal likelihood distributions or a separate statistical evaluation model.\n",
    "5. **Consider larger models**: While bigger models tend to generate higher-quality, more varied suggestions and better understand context, they require **more compute**, especially when running inference on CPU.\n"
